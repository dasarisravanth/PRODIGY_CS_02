**My 2nd task in Prodigy Infotech Internship:-**

**Objective:-** Develop a simple image encryption tool using pixel manipulation techniques. The tool should allow users to encrypt and 
               decrypt images by modifying pixel values through various operations. The process should involve taking the image path as 
               input from the user and saving the encrypted or decrypted image with a corresponding tag at the end of the image name.

**Image Encryption Tool:-**

**Image Encryption:-**

**Purpose:-**

   Encrypt an image by altering its pixel values using predefined operations. This process involves taking the image path as input from 
   the user and saving the encrypted image with the tag "encrypted" appended to the image name.

**Methodology:-**

**Swapping Pixel Values:** Swap the values of pixels based on a predefined pattern or algorithm. For example, swap the values of adjacent 
pixels or pixels at specific intervals using mathematical operations.

**Image Decryption:-**

**Purpose:-**

  Reverse the encryption process to restore the original image form. This involves taking the path of the encrypted image from the user
  and saving the decrypted image with the tag "decrypted" appended to the image name.

**Methodology:-**

**Reversing Pixel Swapping:** Revert the pixel values to their original state by applying the inverse of the encryption algorithm.

**Implementation Outline:-**

**Encrypt Image:-**

* Input: Path to the original image.

* Process: Alter pixel values by swapping or applying mathematical operations.

* Output: Save the encrypted image with "_encrypted" added to the filename.

**Decrypt Image:-**

* Input: Path to the encrypted image.

* Process: Reverse the alterations to restore original pixel values.

* Output: Save the decrypted image with "_decrypted" added to the filename.
